# odin-recipes
First HTML project 
I created a site for a recipe on how to make sopes which is a mexican dish that I enjoy eating. 
It was pretty fun creating however I need to create a habit on adding commits within my code so that it can be a little more coherent. 
I used my basic HTML 5 skills to create the website. Something I forgot to add onto my project was using <strong> bold and <em> emphasis.
